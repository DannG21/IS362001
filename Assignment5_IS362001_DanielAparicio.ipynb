    "In this assignment, we aim to answer three questions related to U.S. airports and weather conditions using Python and pandas for data analysis. The questions focus on identifying the northernmost and easternmost airports in the United States, as well as determining the windiest airport in the New York area on a specific date.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following datasets for our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Airports Dataset: Contains information about airports in the United States, including their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), which will help us determine the northernmost and easternmost airports. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Dataset: Includes weather observations, such as wind speed, for New York area airports. This will allow us to identify the windiest airport on February 12th, 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flights Dataset: Although not directly needed for this specific task, the flights data could help in cross-referencing airport codes and handling additional airport information if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will employ Python and the pandas library to load, filter, and analyze these datasets, using external research to validate our findings where needed. Throughout this process, we will document any assumptions and data adjustments made to ensure the accuracy and validity of our results."
